🚀 RecruitFlow AI Insights | Candidate Dashboard
Project Overview
This is a high-performance React.js dashboard built to solve the "visibility" problem in AI-driven recruitment. While AI backends handle the screening, this interface provides recruiters with a real-time, data-driven view of candidate performance, match scores, and hiring stages.

I built this specifically to demonstrate my readiness for the Software Engineering Intern role, showing that I can bridge the gap between complex AI logic and user-centric frontend design.

🛡️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (Hooks, Functional Components)

Styling: Modern CSS-in-JS (Responsive Design)

Logic: JavaScript ES6+

Inspiration: Autonomous Interview Platforms & Digital Avatars

✨ Key Features
AI-Match Scoring: Instant visual indicators for candidate suitability based on NLP-processed metrics.

Dynamic Status Tracking: Real-time management of candidate stages (Shortlisted, Interviewing, Rejected).

Responsive UI: Built with a "mobile-first" mindset, ensuring accessibility across all devices.

Data Visualization: Clean, professional cards that prioritize essential candidate information.

💡 Why I Built This
As a BCA student at CSJMU with a deep interest in Data Science, I believe that AI is only as good as the interface through which people use it. Following my experience developing an Automated Attendance Monitoring System for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), I wanted to apply similar automation and monitoring principles to the recruitment industry.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Learn and implement React rapidly for industry-specific needs.

Maintain a high level of personal discipline required for remote engineering roles.

Design software with an "AI-first" mindset. ,
